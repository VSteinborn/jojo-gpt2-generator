# jojo-gpt2-generator

In this DIY project I trained a Jojo quote generator using GPT2.

The training procedure for English and Japanese is outlined in the Jupyter notebooks, which may be found in the notebooks directory.

Training data needs to be obtained from Netflix via [language reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/) from the show JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
